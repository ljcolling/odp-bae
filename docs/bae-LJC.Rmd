# Introduction

This document contains the reanalysis  of the following paper:

Bae, G-Y., & Luck, S. J. (2019) Reactivation of previous experience in
a working memory task. *Psychological Science, 30*(4), 587-595.

@Bae performed their analysis in Matlab using EEGLab. Matlab was also used for the reanalysis.

The code for the reanalysis is available at
[https://github.com/ljcolling/odp-bae](https://github.com/ljcolling/odp-bae).
Due to the use of proprietary software, it is not possible to
automatically build this document. To manually build this document, clone
the git repository and run `make`. This makefile is currently only set up
to work with MATLAB R2021 on MacOS. To use with a different version of
Matlab on a difference OS, edit `./data/matlab` as appropriate before
running `make`.

The code in repository depends on `eeglab2021.1`. This is included in the
root of this repository.

`R` is required to build the documentation.

# Results

## Behavioural analysis

Although the supplied data files appear to contain the data needed for
reproducing the behavioural analysis, the data files contain insufficient
metadata to make this possible. Furthermore, some of the minimal metadata that
does exist appears to be incorrect. Apart from the insufficient metadata, the
description of the analysis in the manuscript is to brief to be able to
re-create it with the supplied data.


## Decoding accuracy 

The decoding analysis could largely be performed with the code provided on
the OSF repository. Only one minor edited so made to one of the files to
fix an issue with the specified file path.

After the decoding analysis was performed, the plots for Figure 2c (Experiment
1) and Figure 2d (Experiment 2) could be reasonable reproduced (see below).
Note, however, that it is not possible to reproduce the figure exactly because
the decoding analysis is dependent on a random seed that has not been fixed to
a specific value (either in the original analysis or reproduction).
 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Experiment_1.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Experiment_2.png")
```

Judging from the references in the manuscript, it appears as if the statistical
analyses were performed with the mass univariate toolbox [@Groope]; however,
again the analysis description in manuscript was too brief to easily reproduce
the results.
